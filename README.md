## Overview

This MCP server provides 23 tools to interact with your Garmin Connect account, organized into 8 categories:

- Activities (4 tools) - Query activities, view detailed metrics, and edit or delete activities
- Analysis (2 tools) - Compare activities and find similar workouts
- Health & Wellness (4 tools) - Access health metrics, sleep, heart rate, and activity data
- Training (3 tools) - Analyze training periods and performance trends
- User Profile (1 tool) - Access profile, statistics, and personal records
- Challenges & Goals (2 tools) - Track goals, PRs, badges, and challenges
- Devices & Gear (2 tools) - Manage devices and equipment
- Weight Management (2 tools) - Track weight data
- Other (3 tools) - Workouts, manual data entry, women's health tracking

Additionally, the server provides:

- 3 MCP Resources - Athlete profile, training readiness, and daily health for ongoing context
- 6 MCP Prompts - Templates for common queries (training analysis, sleep quality, readiness checks, activity analysis, run comparison, health summary)

## Prerequisites

- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (the package requires Python 3.12+, which uv can manage), OR
- Docker

## Installation & Setup

### How Authentication Works

1. Credential Authentication - Run the setup command to save credentials
2. MFA Support - If MFA is enabled, the setup command prompts for your code
3. Token Storage - OAuth tokens saved to `~/.garminconnect/` and automatically refreshed
4. Persistence - Tokens persist across runs (UV on host, Docker requires volume mount)

### Option 1: Using uvx

```bash
uvx garmin-connect-mcp auth
```

This will prompt for your credentials, complete Garmin authentication, and save OAuth tokens
for the MCP server to reuse. It writes credentials to `~/.garminconnect.env` by default
and saves OAuth tokens under `~/.garminconnect/`.

If you prefer manual configuration, create `~/.garminconnect.env` yourself:

```bash
GARMIN_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
GARMIN_PASSWORD=your-password
```

### Option 2: Using Docker

```bash
# Pull the image
docker pull ghcr.io/eddmann/garmin-connect-mcp:latest
```

Then configure credentials using one of these methods:

#### Interactive Setup

```bash
# Create the env file first (Docker will create it as a directory if it doesn't exist)
touch garmin-connect-mcp.env

# Run the setup script and persist generated tokens
docker run -it --rm \
  -v "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/garmin-connect-mcp.env:/app/.env" \
  -v "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/.garminconnect-docker:/root/.garminconnect" \
  ghcr.io/eddmann/garmin-connect-mcp:latest \
  auth
```

This will prompt for your credentials, complete Garmin authentication, and save credentials to
`garmin-connect-mcp.env`. If you have MFA enabled, enter the code during this setup step.

#### Manual Setup

Create a `garmin-connect-mcp.env` file manually in your current directory:

```bash
GARMIN_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
GARMIN_PASSWORD=your-password
```

#### MFA Support for Docker

If you have MFA enabled on your Garmin account:

- Run the interactive setup command with `-it` so you can enter your MFA code
- The MCP server should then use saved tokens and should not prompt during runtime
- **Important**: Without token persistence, you'll need to authenticate again on every container restart
- **Recommended**: Mount the token directory as a volume during setup and server runs to persist tokens

To persist tokens across Docker runs, create a directory for tokens and mount it:

```bash
# Create token directory on host
mkdir -p ~/.garminconnect-docker

# Then use this directory in your Docker configuration (see Claude Desktop Configuration below)
```

## Claude Desktop Configuration

Add to your configuration file:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

### Using uvx

After running `uvx garmin-connect-mcp auth`, configure Claude Desktop to start the
published package:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "garmin": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["garmin-connect-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Using Local Source

For development, run from a local checkout:

```bash
cd garmin-connect-mcp
uv sync
uv run garmin-connect-mcp auth
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "garmin": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--directory",
        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/garmin-connect-mcp",
        "garmin-connect-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Using Docker

#### Without Token Persistence (MFA required on every restart)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "garmin": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-v",
        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/garmin-connect-mcp.env:/app/.env",
        "ghcr.io/eddmann/garmin-connect-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

#### With Token Persistence (Recommended for MFA users)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "garmin": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-v",
        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/garmin-connect-mcp.env:/app/.env",
        "-v",
        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/.garminconnect-docker:/root/.garminconnect",
        "ghcr.io/eddmann/garmin-connect-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/.garminconnect-docker` with the absolute path to your token directory. On Windows, use something like `C:\\Users\\YOUR_USERNAME\\.garminconnect-docker`.

## Usage

Ask Claude to interact with your Garmin data using natural language. The server provides tools, resources, and prompt templates to help you get started.

### Quick Start with MCP Prompts

Use built-in prompt templates for common queries (available via prompt suggestions in Claude):

- `analyze_recent_training` - Analyze my training over the past 30 days
- `sleep_quality_report` - Analyze sleep quality with recommendations
- `training_readiness_check` - Check if I'm ready to train hard today
- `activity_deep_dive` - Deep dive into a specific activity
- `compare_recent_runs` - Compare recent runs to track progress
- `health_summary` - Show comprehensive health overview

### Activities

```
"Show me my runs from the last 30 days"
"Get details for my half marathon yesterday including splits and heart rate zones"
"Show me the comments on my latest cycling activity"
```

### Training Analysis

```
"Analyze my training over the past 30 days"
"Compare my last three 10K runs"
"Find runs similar to my tempo workout from last week"
```

### Health & Wellness

```
"How did I sleep last night?"
"What's my Body Battery level today?"
"Show me my stress levels and recovery status"
"Am I ready to train hard today?"
```

_Note: The athlete profile resource (`garmin://athlete/profile`) and daily health resource (`garmin://health/today`) automatically provide ongoing context._

### Performance Metrics

```
"What's my VO2 max trend?"
"Show me my training readiness and recent stats"
```

_Note: List-returning tools use cursor-based pagination with default limits (10 items for activities, 7 for health data)._
